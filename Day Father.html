<h1>HAPPY FATHER'S DAY DAD!</h1>
“You’re the best, Dad. I love you!”
“I’m so proud to be your son.”
“Dad, you’re in all my favorite memories.”
“Dad, you’re still the one I think of first when I have a question about something or when I just need some support and good advice. Thank you for always being there for me.”
“Happy Father’s Day to the man who taught me how to step and throw, how to field a grounder, how to follow through and pretty much every other important thing I know about baseball and living!”
“Happy Father’s Day to the man who put the fear into all my homecoming and prom dates…and who still treats me like a princess!”
“You taught me so many of the important things I know—including a few choice words for certain situations.”
“Thank you for being there every day with just the love and guidance I’ve needed.”
“You’re my one and only dad, and I’ll always have a special place in my heart for you.”
“God gave me such a good gift when he gave me you for a father.”
“You made growing up fun.”
